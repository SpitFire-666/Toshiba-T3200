# ‚Ñπ Gotchas / Things Worth Knowing

- Early models have a 720KB floppy drive - NOT 1.44MB. Later models included a 1.44MB drive
- Additional memory is on a proprietary expansion card - there are no SIMM slots etc
- External monitor is connected via a CGA connector - NOT VGA
- Accessing the internals involves disassembling the screen (removing the LED stickers)
- Keyboard layout is non-standard. For example, no F11, F12. Alt key is ABOVE Ctrl key. Esc key is where Num Lock would usually be

# Hardware

## Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

Known models:
- Fujitsu M2227DT

### Alternatives
- XT-IDE CF works fine for me, even with a working HDD. It boots off the original HDD and mounts the CF card as D:\
- To boot from an XT-IDE card, you need to access the BIOS and set HDD to ```None```
- Installing an unsupported HDD via a SCSI card: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdotvenfClw

## Switches/Buttons/Ports

- A/B/PRT should be set to PRT. This switch controls what the parallel port functions as.

With switch set to "A", external FDD port is accessed as drive A; internal 3.5" FDD as drive B.
With switch set to "B", external FDD port is accessed as drive B; internal 3.5" FDD as drive A.
Switch is set to "PRT" for parallel printer output.
Computer must be re-booted for switch change to take effect.
